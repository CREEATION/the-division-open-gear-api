# The Division Gear Data & Attributes
Open API & data source for gear data and attributes in **The Division 2**.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about accessibility, but at the same time I think accessibility is also just advanced user customization:
>
> giving players as many options as we can to allow them to play the way they want to play, because in the end, we want as many people as possible to enjoy our game, no matter who they are.‚Äù

# Plans
- Open API to get gear data from for app developers
- Multi-Language support
- Proper versioning so apps don't break on updates
- Find out how to datamine all of this from the game
- (Semi-)Automate?

# Limitations
- The only known, biggest data source right now is the [The Division 2 Gear Attribute Sheet on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMyKlW90Q2H3RDKXF7cISzVgs7aM9tjqFtf2ZH6i1e_U_8K_LUD2-2ccTrXrgsLBUW15U-9z7u5tgz/pubhtml#)
- No knowledge of how to datamine the game and possible consequences when doing so
- Possibly no support from [Massive Entertainment](https://www.massive.se) üò• ([raise your voice!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?hashtags=TheDivision2,Community&text=Please%20consider%20sharing%20more%20in-depth%20game%20data%20with%20us%20%F0%9F%A7%A1&url=https://github.com/creeation/the-division-gear/&via=TheDivisionGame))
